#summary A glossary of Orchestra terms.

= Glossary =

*_Epoch Number_* global counter in the Update Store, similiar to a subversion revision number. Starts at 0.

*_Labeled Null_* different form SQL null - we can join on labeled nulls. They can be used when inferring new values though mappings. _1_ indicates there is no labeled null. All other values than _1_ are Skolem values. 

*_Publish_* when a peer publishes it notifies the _Update Store_ of local deltas to its instance since the peer's last publish. Publish is currently always followed by Update Exchange.

Note that only net changes are included. If for example a tuple is inserted then deleted, nothing would be sent to the update store. If a tuple was inserted, deleted, and inserted, only one insert would be sent to the update store.

*_Reconcile_* a version of Update Exchange, not currently implemented, that includes the use of trust conditions to decide what tuples get inserted and deleted. In some contexts, reconcile is used interchangeable with Update Exchange. 

*_Reconcile Number_* another name for _Epoch Number_

*_State Store_* 

*_Update Exchange_*

*_Update Store_* the hub of an Orchestra system. See [UpdateStore]
