*_Epoch Number_* global counter in the Update Store, similiar to a subversion revision number. Starts at 0.

*_Labeled Null_* different form SQL null - we can join on labeled nulls. They can be used when inferring new values though mappings. _1_ indicates there is no labeled null. All other values than _1_ are Skolem values. 

*_Publish_* when a peer publishes it notifies the _Update Store_ of local changes to its instance since the peer's last publish. Publish is currently always followed by Update Exchange.

*_Reconcile Number_* another name for _Epoch Number_

*_State Store_* 

*_Update Exchange_*

*_Update Store_* the hub of an Orchestra system. See [UpdateStore]
