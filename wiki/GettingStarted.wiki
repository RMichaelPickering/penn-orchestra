= Setting Up Your Development Environment in Eclipse=

Here's the way that we set up our development environment:

  # get the Eclipse Classic package from, for example, [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/]
  # install the [http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/ M2Eclipse] Eclipse plugin. At a minimim you'll need the following items:
    * Maven Integration/Maven Embedder
    * Maven Integration/Maven Integration for Eclipse
    * Maven Optional Components/Maven SCM Handler for Subclipse
  # install the [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ Subclipse] Eclipse plugin. At a minimum you'll need the required items: 
    * Subclipse/Subclipse
    * Subclipse/Subversion Client Adapter
    * Sublcipse/Subversion JavaHL Native Library Adapter
  # install the [http://testng.org/doc/eclipse.html TestNG] Eclipse plugin
  # fire up Eclipse and switch over to the `SVN Repository Exploring` perspective and create a repository at [http://penn-orchestra.googlecode.com/svn/] if you're not a commiter or [https://penn-orchestra.googlecode.com/svn/] if you're a committer
  # Navigate to http(s)://penn-orchestra.googlecode.com/branches and right-click (ctrl-click on Macs) to orchestra-0.1.x and choose _Check out as Maven Project_
    * Some of us like to choose a the Name Template [artifactId]-[version] under advanced but that doesn't seem to work on OS X
    * Hit Finish

= Running the tests =

Some of the tests require access to a DB2 instance. The connection information is supplied to the tests via Maven resource filtering, so the following variables need to be set as described [http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/examples/filter.html here]:
   * {{{testng.db-url}}}
   * {{{testng.db-user}}}
   * {{{testng.db-password}}}
