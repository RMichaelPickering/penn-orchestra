=Demo=
Zack suggested using a VMWare player to create a demo. We would need to do:
==Tasks==
  # Download free VMWare player.
  # Pick our favorite Linux distro from VMWare's appliance selection.
  # Run that in our player. Install free DB2 in the player. Install Orchestra in the player.
  # Save the VM image.
  # Distribute the VM image to people for a no-config way to play with Orchestra.
==Questions==
  * Can you actually save the VM image using the Player?
    * You might only be able to save the image with a non-free version. VM Studio might be able to do it.
