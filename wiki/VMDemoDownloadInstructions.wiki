#summary Download instructions for the virtual machine demo.

= Virtual Machine Demo =

We have created a virtual machine with an Orchestra installation already configured and ready to go. We've tested it with the free [http://www.vmware.com/products/player/ VMWare Player] (Windows, Linux) and the non-free [http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/ VMWare Fusion] (Mac), but is should work other VMWare products.


= Instructions =
  # Install VMWare Player or VMWare Fusion.
  # Download the virtual machine: [https://dbappserv.cis.upenn.edu/orchestra-demo/orchestra-demo.zip orchestra-demo.zip] (about 2.5 GB).
  # Unzip orchestra-demo.zip and open orchestra-demo/orchestra-demo.vmx with your VMWare product.
  # Log on to the virtual machine:
    * user: _db2inst1_
    * password: _orchestra_
  # Once logged on, you should see a README.html icon on the desktop. Double-click this for   further instructions on how to run the demo.
